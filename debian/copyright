Comment:
 While the project as a whole is GPL-3+, a full-text copy of GPL-2+ should
 be also be included so anyone can verify compatibility without  having to
 look elsewhere for the full-text license.  A pull request that includes a
 full-text copy of the GPL-2+ as "LICENSE.GPL-2" was filed upstream at the
 following URL: https://github.com/jrockway/eproject/pull/71

Comment:
 Glauber Prado and Thomas Frössman's probable copyright was established by
 examining the upstream git history. I opened an upstream issue titled
 "contrib/helm-eproject: Needs Copyright header" with the following text:
 > By examining the git history I found that Glauber Alex Dias Prado and
 > Thomas Frössmam both committed more than 15 lines of changes to this
 > file in 2012. If they didn't attribute copyright to you, please add a
 > copyright header with their information. If they did attribute it to
 > you, please make this explicit by adding yourself to the file's
 > copyright header. It's ambiguous right now.
